# Bank Management System (Python OOP)

This is my second Python project, developed to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It simulates a basic banking interface where users can manage their accounts securely.

 Features

* **Secure Transactions:** Deposit and withdraw money with real-time balance updates.
* **Authentication System:** A password-protected access layer for sensitive operations.
* **Retry Logic:** Users have limited attempts for password entry before the transaction is canceled.
* **Security First:** Password change functionality that requires old password verification and new password confirmation.
* **Error Handling:** Basic error management to handle invalid inputs.

Concepts Learned

Throughout this project, I focused on:
* **Classes and Objects:** Structuring the system using the `class` keyword.
* **Encapsulation:** Managing data like `balance` and `password` within the object.
* **Control Flow:** Using `while` loops for retry mechanisms and `if-else` blocks for security checks.
* **User Interaction:** Mastering the `input()` function to create a dynamic experience.

Project Structure

* `banka.py`: The main script containing the `banka` class and its methods.
 How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script using Python: `python banka.py`.
3. Create an instance of the `banka` class and start managing your account!
